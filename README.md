This project is a web-based service management system developed for **LYNX Fiber Internet**, a local internet service provider. It streamlines customer service by allowing users to request installations, manage subscriptions,
handle billing, track maintenance requests, and communicate through integrated support tools.

The system was developed as part of a capstone thesis project that aims to implement an Online Service Management System for LYNX Fiber Internet with 2D Mapping and Chatbot integration that will help its owners and employees evaluate the submitted subscription applications, transact monthly subscription payments, monitor the statuses of their subscribers, send notification via SMS, answer the queries and concerns through a Chatbot, and easily locate the residences of their subscribers in a virtual map
