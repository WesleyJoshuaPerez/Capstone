This project is a web-based service management system developed for **LYNX Fiber Internet**, a local internet service provider. It streamlines customer service by allowing users to request installations, manage subscriptions,
handle billing, track maintenance requests, and communicate through integrated support tools.

The system was developed as part of a capstone thesis project to enhance operational efficiency and user experience for both clients and administrators.
